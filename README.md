# 🚀 Fast DNS Finder · Benchmark and Reveal the Best DNS in Seconds

# Usage
DNS Test is a shell script that requires curl or wget; on macOS/Linux it may prompt once for sudo to install Homebrew during the initial neofetch setup before continuing automatically.

## Launch Command

Stable (recommended)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F3aarLeSS/DNSTest/main/NeoDNS_Top3.command | bash
```


Alternate (download then run)
```bash
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/neodns.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F3aarLeSS/DNSTest/main/NeoDNS_Top3.command && bash /tmp/neodns.sh
```


Notes
- Use -fsSL so curl fails fast on HTTP errors, stays quiet, and follows redirects when hitting Raw GitHub links.
- Pin to a tag like v1.0.0 for reproducible runs and to avoid changes from main impacting automation.

## What You Get
- System info via neofetch; if missing, the script can interactively install Homebrew and then install neofetch before proceeding.
- Smooth progress bars while pinging primary and secondary IPv4 endpoints for multiple DNS providers.
- Cross‑platform parsing of ping summaries: Linux “rtt min/avg/max …” and macOS “round‑trip min/avg/max …” for accurate averages.
- A final Top 3 with large centered banners showing Provider, IP, and average latency for quick selection.

## Troubleshooting
- If a Raw link shows code instead of running, fetch it with curl/wget and pipe to bash or download then execute; avoid the blob URL.
- If Homebrew install is blocked, run the official installer once and then re‑run the script; shellenv exports PATH for immediate use.
- For fully non‑interactive runs, preinstall Homebrew and neofetch, then use the stable one‑liner above.
